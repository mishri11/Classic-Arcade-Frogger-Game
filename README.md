# Introduction

This is an application I created in the course of my Udacity Front End Nanodegree. Udacity provided the basic game engine (which just renders images on a canvas repeatedly) and it was up to me to write the code for the elements of the game (the enemies, the player, etc.).

# How to Run the Application

To run the application, just download this repository, unzip, and just open index.html in your favorite browser!

# How to Play

Your goal is to move the player to the other side (to the water) by using the up, down, left, and right keys. Whenever you hit an enemy bug, the player will get moved back to the start position and begin again.
